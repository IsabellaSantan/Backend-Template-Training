 Project Name & Summary:

 🎯My Virtual Assistant
 My project will be able to create a morning and night routine and make with things that you will be able to check off throught
 the morning as you start to do them. It will help you stay on track and be customizable so that the average person would be able to create their own morning/night rountine

👥Target User:
The target user is someone who is always busy. Who is thinking about their job or their work and they inevitabley forget something. It's for someone that prefers something virtual rather than pen and paper. 

💡Purpose & Problem Statement:
The problem my project solves is an organization problem. Sometimes you just cant remeber everything or you need something to help you organize. If my project had a super power it would be time travel. It would be able to go back and time and get whatever you missed or make sure you set your alarm for the next day.
